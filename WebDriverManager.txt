WebDriverManager

    ----> webDriverManager helps as in managing driver.exe files for our browser.
    ----> webDriverManager downloads the required driver.exe file for the given browser and sets the property and launches the browser by itself.
    ----> instead of System.setProperty() we can use following WebDriverManager method to set the property for the browser launch
             
                           WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
                           WebDriver driver = new Chromedriver();
             
                           WebDriverManager.edgedriver().setup();
                           WebDriver driver = new Edgedriver();

    -----> latest version of webDriverManager makes it much more simple
    -----> with the latest version of webDriverManager we can launch the browser with an single line of code
                          
                            WebDriver driver = WebDriverManager.chromedriver().create();

                            WebDriver driver = WebDriverManager.edgedriver().create();

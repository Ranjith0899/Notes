SDP 

         We use SDP mainly to hide the test data
         In SDP we all our test data will be stored in properties file as key and value pair 
         We get the test data from properties file in TestDataReader class using methods from properties class such as load() and getproperties()
         At first we intialize the  properties with refname  in class levelop as public and static   -------> public satic Properties p:
         TestDataReader class we first create the file usind File refname = new File(path);  --------> File f = new File(path);
         then we pass that file in FileInputStream refname = new FileInputStream(File refname);  ------> FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f)
         then we create the object for properties class p = new properties(); 
         then we pass the fileinputstream in load method which will let us to get the test data from properties file using getProperties(); method.

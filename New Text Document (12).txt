What If -----> An Developer doesn't acknowledge defect found by the Tester as a BUG


                    As An Tester we can convince our Developer about the severity and priority of the defect as follows

---> If the Developer doesn't acknowledge the defect found by us as an Bug, as tester we must have to RETEST the scenario and we have to test the scenario from 
     different ENVIRONMENT and we have to make sure our defect is reproducible with our test steps and record the occurrence of the defect as proof.
---> Then try to convince your developer about the severity and priority of the defect that you found.
---> If your Developer don't accept the defect use screen play-back records such as QARepaly to record the test results and show them to the Developer and try to 
     put them in testers point and make them to accept it as a bug.
---> Even though the Developer doesn't accept it because of the difference in point of view of you and your Developer on the defect you can also seek help of other 
     Developers to explain the defect to your Developer.
---> If the Developer doesn't change his mind at all the take the defect to test lead even test lead doesn't take it seriously or not accepting it you can escalate
     the issue  take it to test manager even they don't accept it you can make the final call with product owner or Business Analyst who closely interact with 
     client if they telling it is not a problem you can write a B.A comment in JIRA / Test Case and close it or if they accept it as bug then you can send a 
     mail regarding the Bug to the Developer , Test Lead , Test Manager and inform why it is a Bug.

Note :  Sometimes we testers are right sometimes our Developers may right. The bottom line is not to win a game over Developer. Keep good relationship with Developers
        it must have to be win-win relat

TestQuality has all the test management capabilities you need for creating, maintaining, organizing, and running tests in Cypress, but TestQuality is 
different from other test management tools in that it is a Test Management Case built for GitHub and Jira workflows and designed to be integrated with 
virtually all unit testing tools and test automation frameworks like Cypress.

TestQuality also includes features to create and organize Cypress test cases in a global test repository - with preconditions, steps, attachments, and more. 
All this, in a collaborative testing environment seamlessly integrated with your CI/CD DevOps workflow with powerful live analytics to help you to identify the
 quality of your testing effort, test coverage, high value tests, unreliable tests, and release readiness.          


Protactor
Protractor is another open-source Selenium alternative designed primarily for testing Angular web applications. Protractor runs end-to-end tests in JavaScript by
 interacting with the application as a user. As a WebDriverJS wrapper, Protractor supports frameworks such as Cucumber, Mocha, and Jasmine for writing test suites.

Aside from being easier to use in terms of programming language, Protractor is also said to be easier to use than Selenium for Angular apps. It is also built on 
JavaScript Selenium WebDriver, so your team will gain all of Selenium WebDriver's features in addition to Protractor's other advantages.

Protractor offers what it is called 'Automatic Waiting' functionality, which makes the test to automatically execute the next step without waiting for the 
webpage and test to sync. 
Because Protractor is only available in one language, users should be familiar with JavaScript.
Protractor can also run against your Selenium servers, so you can use it as a supplement to Selenium if you run a lot of Selenium tests.

Watir
Watir is an abbreviation for Web Application Testing in Ruby. Watir is an open-source Ruby library for web browser automation.

Watir as an alternative to Selenium Test Automation framework operates a variety of browsers, including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome, in the same 
manner as humans use. It offers a full-featured contemporary scripting language that makes building and maintaining test scripts simple.

Methodology :
                  Waterfall
                  Agile

Waterfall Model :
                   Dev and QA team will be working separately
 
                   this model leds to delay of endproduct
                   
                   we cant find defects at early stage
             
                   Testers only recive the product after developed
                  
                   No Iterative and Increment model approach

Agile :
            It is an methodogy
    two types / board
                           Scrum   ---------> Depends on Sprint

                           Kanban  --------->  
                                                                    
                   Dev and QA team will  working together
 
                   this model leds to get of endproduct faster
                   
                   we can find defects at early stage
             
                   Testers perform smoke testing frequently    
                  
                   Iterative and Increment model approach

Smoke testing  
                it will perform critical functionalities of the module
                mainly focused on build stability
 Scrum board :
                  Depends upon Sprint basics

Two Types of Sprints
                            n-1 Automation
                            Insprint Automation

 Sprit : regular interval of time to complete the paricular work / USER STORIES
  Time : 14 days - 28 days / 2 weeks - 4 weeks

      Insprint Automation : 
                             Dev and QA Working together in same sprint
                             Sprint time : Max 4 weeks
      n-1 Automation :
                        once dev complete the unit Testing we will get the user stories after the sprint
                        sprint time : Max 4 weeks
